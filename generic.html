								<p>Hello! If you made it this far, you probably wanted to learn a little more about Wilson. I am currently 28 and am the oldest son with two 
									awesome younger siblings. Probably the best description of my interests is that I am a "gamer." I love all sorts of games from sports to board
									games to video games. Currently, my biggest hobby is probably rock climbing, but I also play a few sports (hockey and volleyball) weekly. My 
									family has always been pretty outdoorsy, but lately, I have been getting more interested in going on more of my own adventures.

									<h2>Family</h2>

								<a class="image fit"><img src="images/Family.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>I have been very spoiled with an amazing and tight-knit family. These are my little brother, aunt, little sister, and mom from left to right.

								<a class="image fit"><img src="" alt="" /></a>
								<p>
									Lately, I have been very into climbing. My gym is the Movement in Santa Clara, and I am slowly improving. I am a pretty big guy, so it is not
									easy lugging myself up the wall, but it is a great time!

									<h2>Gaming</h2>

								<a class="image fit"><img src="images/Rocket.png" alt="" /></a>
								<p>
									As I mentioned from the start, I am super into games. Currently, I have a group of friends that I regularly play games with. These nights
									consist of playing all sorts of board games, and occasionally role-playing games. As for video games, at the moment, my two main online games
									are Rocket League and Age of Empires 2, but I enjoy a lot of other single-player and co-op games of many genres. I particularly enjoy strategy. 
									I grew up playing water polo at a fairly competitive level, but these days I mostly play other sports, and can never really get enough of them.
									Lastly, go sharks!

									<h2>Programming</h2>
								</header>
								<a class="image fit"><img src="" alt="" /></a>
								<p>I was a little late to the party, but I genuinely enjoy programming, and have found leet-coding very enjoyable when I am looking for something
									productive to do but am a bit stressed out with one thing or another. So far, I have been able to solve the vast majority of the problems
									without aid, and just find it very rewarding to solve a tough problem.

								<p>You didn't need to. These are my boys, Xhaka (husky), Doug (lab), and Ziggy (who knows). They are quite silly guys and can be quite a 
									handful, but just look at them.
